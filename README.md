Project: Investigating the No-Show Appointments dataset
Adaobi Onyeakagbu

This project involves wrangling, cleaning and analysing the No-Show Appointments dataset, originally provided by Kaggle. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. From the number of patient characteristics, the main focus is on:
- The factors which determine if a Patient missed their appointment or not. For this, gender, ages, appointment day and SMS received are investigated to see if there are correlations between them and Patient Appointment turn out.
- What illnesses are determined by the ages of a patient. For this the correlations between age and Alcoholism, Diabetes and Hypertension are looked into.

Exploratory analysis observations
1. The Gender of patients doesn't seem to have any effect on patients turning up for their appointment or not.
2. Appointment count drops heavily as age increases
3. Most people between the age of 0-10 turn up for their appointments. More people between the ages of 10-30 missed their appointments more compared to people between the ages of 0-10. People between 40-60 missed their appointments less as well.
4. Patients between the ages of 45 and 75 have more cases of hypertension (72.18%), with patients between 60 and 65 having the hightest number and most people who have hypertension showed up for their appointments.
5. The patients that have diabetes are mostly within the range of 50-75 (67.87% of diabetes patients), with 55-65 having the highest number.
6. No clear relationship between alcoholism and age.
7. Tuesdays and Wednesdays had the higher number of appointments while Saturdays had the least. Saturdays had the highest percentage of missed appointments at 23%.
8. The sending of SMS to patients has an effect on their turning up as 23.25% of people showed up when they received SMS reminders, much higher than the 8.85% who didn't though they received SMS.
